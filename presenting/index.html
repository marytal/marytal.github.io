<p>If I have one regret about my University degree it’s that I will not be able to fit a Public Speaking course into my schedule. While presenting is an incredibly useful skill that would benefit the trajectory of any profession, I have had little to no practice with it. </p>

<p>That is why I found the Ted Talk assignment both incredibly challenging and rewarding. I first wrote out my Ted Talk in the manner with which I am most familiar, essay style. An introduction, three supporting paragraphs, and a conclusion filled 3 pages. As I read my essay aloud, trying to memorize the words, I realized how uninteresting it sounded. That is when I took a look at “Structure Your Presentation Like a Story” by Nancy Duarte. </p>

<p>I wanted my presentation to fit “Aristotle’s three-part story structure (beginning, middle, end)” (Duarte, 2012). I started off by “crafting the beginning” which consisted of “describing life as the audience knows it” (Duarte, 2012). I relayed my experience with choosing a career path and what criteria I used to decide – typical stuff that a typical audience member (in my target audience) would relate to, opening them up to my ideas. Then, slightly deviating from Duarte’s steps, I pointed out the flaws and the negative outcomes that can arise from following the path that I had followed – and laying out the alternatives that would ameliorate them. I hope that this was enough to jar/surprise the audience (a necessary ingredient of crafting the beginning), as my “vision” is not (yet) widely accepted as the better path. </p>

<p>The next step, “developing the middle”, consists of “playing up the contrast between what is and what could be” (Duarte, 2012). I feel that I could have done this better had I written out my Ted Talk with this goal in mind. Unfortunately, once all the ideas are down on paper, it is more difficult for me to make connections that I otherwise could have made. That being said, I managed to make a few comparisons between the different types of goals that each criterion would help one reach. This made my conclusions stronger and more relevant. </p>

<p>Finally, I believe that I managed to “make the ending powerful” with a call to action and a reitteration of my vision for my listeners. </p>

<p>“If you take one thing away from what I’ve told you, make it this. Life doesn’t only take place from 9:00 to 5:00, nor does it only take place from 5:00 to 9:00. In order to be happy, most people need a comfortable work-life balance. Make your balance a priority and you’ll be making your happiness a priority.” ()</p>

<p>My Ted Talk turned out to be engaging and interesting (according to some sources, at least) and I hope to continue to grow in my story telling and presenting abilities. Watch my Ted Talk below if you’re interested. </p>
