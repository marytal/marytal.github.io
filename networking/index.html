<p>I had never quite put it into words before, but I suppose I always considered networking to be somewhat unethical. I felt that getting a job not through ‘what you know’, but ‘whom you know’ was a lesser form of nepotism that I didn’t want to prescribe to.  I also hated the idea of making “fake friends”, keeping in touch with people who you don’t want to keep in touch with in the hopes of one day benefitting off of the relationship. This was a shallow view of networking. </p>

<p>I’m happy to say that after reading “How to Use Natural Networking to Connect With Anyone”, my perspective has shifted. The article called me out on my false ideas, “Most people think networking is about being sleazy, slimy, and scammy” (Sethi, 2012), and made me realize that networking doesn’t have to be purely about self-interest. </p>

<p>What I gathered from the article was that networking can simply be about maintaining acquaintances, “top performers are comfortable meeting people and cultivating relationships with no specific purpose” (Sethi, 2012). This helped me feel more open to networking – and to realize the vast similarities between building one’s network and making friends in class, for example. I always attempt to make at least one acquaintance in class so that, should I miss a lecture, I might borrow notes. I don’t consider this unethical or “sleazy” at all – I see it as mutually beneficial and pleasant. I don’t suck up to people or feel indifferent to them – I genuinely search for those who I would like to be acquainted with. Seeing Networking in this light drives my desire to become a more active networker. The field of work (in my case, programming) is like a classroom, and contacts are the friends that can be counted on when a need arises from either end of the relationship. No inauthenticity necessary!</p>

<p>Second, I learned that Networking could be simply about meeting with someone you are interested in learning more about. The author claims that informational interviews, where people can come and ask questions, are an incredibly useful place to meet people in a field they are interested in (Sethi, 2012). These interviews reminded me of the Networking event we attended in March, and I can see why the author would highlight their usefulness.  </p>
