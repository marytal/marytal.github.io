<p><a href="/eportfolio">ePortfolio Links</a></p>

<p>Personal Branding, I’ve learned, is not just about promotion but also about differentiation. (Pressley, 2012) I began my personal branding process by writting out my <a href="/assets/missionstatement.pdf">mission statement</a>. Once I outlined what made me different, I was able to see my strengths and weaknesses more clearly. “your strengths are assets that help you promote your capabilities. Your weaknesses give you a blueprint for self-improvement.” (Pressley, 2012)</p>

<p>It became clear to me as I wrote that if I am to become a programmer by profession, my greatest hindrance right out of University would simultaneously be my best asset years later.</p>

<p>The fact that I am not getting a computer science degree has made my job search quite difficult. Often I see requirements such as, “must be enrolled in a computer science or engineering major” when applying for internships. This has had me believing that I am at a disadvantage when it comes to my personal brand as a programmer when, after some thought, I now see it (mostly) as an advantage. </p>

<p>It may be more difficult for me to find a high paying programming job right out of University due to the fact that I don’t have as much experience or knowledge as CS majors. However, I can compensate for this weakness now that I am aware of its existence. My blueprint will guide my development and once I prove that my programming skills are quite unharmed by my slightly less intensive formal education, my degree will seize to be a weakness and wholly become a strength. It will be a positive rarity in the tech community that will differentiate me from others with a similar skillset. As long as I continue to develop my programming skills my employers will not consider me a less educated programmer, rather they will consider my degree as a rare asset that may be called upon throughout my employment. </p>

<p>My personal brand will forever continue to grow and change, as it has in the past. I will do the best that I can to direct it in a path that will aid my career and my profesional persona. I am both satisfied with what I have achieved and anxious to achieve more, improve more, and add value to my brand.</p>
