<p><a href="/eportfolio">ePortfolio Links</a></p>

<p>The day after I accepted my summer job offer we learned about negotiation techniques in class. We were introduced to the reservation price (the lowest offer one would accept), the aspiration level (the highest offer one hopes for), and the BATNA (the best alternative to a negotiated agreement). These terms and techniques would have helped me with my conundrum of the previous day. </p>

<p>The Sunday before our Monday class, for the first time in my history of being employed, my new supervisor asked me what I thought my salary should be. I was dumbfounded. I didn’t know how much I was worth to them. I didn’t know how much their other interns would receive. As I filled with both anxiety at seeming greedy and gratitude at the offer I decided that it didn’t matter what my salary was (but of course it mattered). I would low-ball it to seem excited about the work, and not the pay. </p>

<p>After looking into co-op salary averages (by discipline) on the University’s website I gave my employer a range that didn’t seem greedy and was consistent with the averages. To my surprise and disappointment, my employer quickly offered me the highest salary I had suggested. Why was I disappointed? I thought that maybe I had asked for too little. If only I had taken the time to properly evaluate my worth, my needs, and my wants, I may have felt differently about the outcome. </p>

<p>Luckily, I found an article by Martin Yate about these three useful steps to do just that. </p>

<h4 id="step-one">Step One</h4>
<p>“Given your experience, determine the least you would need to put food on your table and a roof over your head.” (Yate, 2015)</p>

<p>Although I didn’t have extensive experience, I had some. I also didn’t take into account the higher standard of living in Vancouver as well as the expenses that I would incur relocating. Next time I’ll know to do this. </p>

<h4 id="step-two">Step Two</h4>
<p>“Determine what would constitute a fair offer for a suitable job with a stable company.” (Yate, 2015)</p>

<p>I had a rough idea about this based on my friends’ salaries as well as the co-op averages but in all my rush I ended up under calculating. The “weekly” values I saw on the University website were for 37 hour workweeks, not 40 hour weeks. Next time I’ll ask more friends and connections about what to expect. </p>

<h4 id="and-finally-step-three">And finally, Step Three</h4>
<p>“Given the same considerations of a suitable job with a stable company, come up with the offer that would make you smile, drop dead, and go to heaven.” (Yate, 2015)</p>

<p>The lowest number would be my reservation price. The next number would be the midpoint at which my range would start and the last one would be the high point at which my range would end, or my aspiration level. This way, my bargaining zone would include a lot of room for me to be satisfied with the final outcome. </p>

<p>I look forward to the next time I am asked, “how much money do you want?” because by then I will be prepared to answer well.  </p>
